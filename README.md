# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this Election Audit was to utilize Python skills to read a CSV and extract relevant data. In particular, the data extraction was to inform us of the election results, including the percentage of votes, the count of votes, and votes split by candidate and by county. Additionally, a purpose was to display our skills in writing text to a txt file from a python script.

## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used for any election that contains tabular data with Candidate, County, and a unique ID for each vote. This would eliminate the need for human/manual counting, thereby enhancing the accuracy and integrity of the election process. One modification to this script would be to adjust the names of the dictionaries, like County_Name if this election were on a larger scale. Another modification could involve an alternate code that reaches the same answer, as a means to compare final results for accuracy. Checking 2 pieces of code that achieve the same goal will add another layer of confidence in the results.
